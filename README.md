# Jupyter Docker stacks examples

This repository contains a few example Docker setups that leverage the
[Docker stacks provided by Jupyter](https://github.com/jupyter/docker-stacks/)
to provide Docker images for your own work.

These examples are used and presented in the SSC course *Containers in Science:
Using Docker and Singularity*.
